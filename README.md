These may come as a surprise: ðŸ™Š

* `css`: Where we store stylesheets (vendors and our own) - minify vendors', keep our own readable.
* `js`: Where we store javascript files (vendors and our own) - minify vendors', keep our own readable.
* `fonts`: Where we store fonts - Noto Sans is required for Materialize CSS.
* `img`: Where we store images (and that one video for the hero section) - make sure they're optimized for page loads.

Only jQuery and Materialize Icons is delivered through CDN for now.

## Materialize CSS

We use a custom version of Materialize CSS v0.100.2 (with fonts changed to Noto Sans in the vendors' source).
